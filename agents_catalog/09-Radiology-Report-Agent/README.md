# Radiology Report Validator Agent

Validates radiology reports against American College of Radiology (ACR) guidance
documents. In many radiology departments, senior radiologists must review and
validate reports written by junior colleagues — a critical but time-consuming
bottleneck. This agent evaluates a report against the relevant ACR guideline
document and returns terse, actionable feedback: whether the report adheres to
ACR guidelines, is detailed enough to support a diagnosis, is missing key
anatomical structures, and meets ACR quality standards.

It does document-grounded validation, not clinical diagnosis. Clinical questions
should be referred to qualified healthcare professionals.

## Implementation

This agent runs on the **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime** using the **Strands
SDK**. See [`agentcore/`](./agentcore/) for the implementation, deployment, and
tests.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `download_guidance_document(anatomical_structure)` | Downloads the ACR guidance PDF(s) matching a modality/anatomical structure (e.g. `Chest`) from S3. |
| `run_validator(report)` | Grounds an Amazon Bedrock `converse` call on the staged ACR guideline PDF and returns actionable validation feedback. |

## Guidance documents

The ACR guideline PDFs live in [`ACRdocs/`](./ACRdocs/). Upload them to the S3
bucket the agent reads from (see [`agentcore/README.md`](./agentcore/README.md)
for bucket configuration and IAM requirements), keying each object so the
anatomical structure appears in the key (e.g. `Chest/ACR_Chest.pdf`).

## Migration note

This agent was migrated from a notebook-driven Amazon Bedrock Agent with a Lambda
action group to Strands + AgentCore (issue #370). The original Lambda instantiated
SageMaker and AWS Batch clients and read `BATCH_JOB_*` environment variables that
its implemented functions never used; that dead wiring was dropped in the
migration. The previous `create_agent.ipynb` notebook and `lambda/` action group
have been removed in favor of the `agentcore/` implementation.
